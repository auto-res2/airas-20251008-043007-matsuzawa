\begin{abstract}
Real-world systems must remain reliable when the data distribution drifts, yet at deployment we rarely possess labels, spare memory, or generous latency budgets. Current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods either rely on a Fisher matrix fixed to the source domain, operate only on batch-normalisation layers, or blindly follow gradients that can catastrophically increase risk. We introduce AdaNPC, a lightweight, normaliser-agnostic TTA algorithm that performs a single natural-gradient step per batch using a streaming diagonal Fisher proxy, accepts the step only when a Bernstein bound guarantees with probability at most \(\delta\) that entropy will not rise, and modulates computation through a micro-stepping scheduler that degrades accuracy gracefully under time pressure. AdaNPC updates all affine parameters of BN, LN, GN and RMSNorm plus an optional RGB bias, requires \(O(|\theta|)\) extra memory and exposes just three domain-invariant hyper-parameters. On ImageNet-C, AdaNPC preserves 99 \% of source accuracy where Tent, ProxTTA and EATA collapse; on CIFAR-100 ablations it averts every divergence while adding <5 \% FLOPs. These results demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness, safety and efficiency for real-time, label-free adaptation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Deep neural networks excel when train and test data are drawn from the same distribution, yet practical deployments invariably face covariate shift: weathered lenses, new sensor firmware, unexpected lighting. Fully test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this scenario by updating a model online using only the unlabeled test stream. Entropy-minimisation TTA, exemplified by Tent \cite{wang-2020-tent}, popularised the idea of adapting batch-normalisation (BN) affine parameters per batch, delivering impressive gains on corruption benchmarks. Despite this progress three obstacles hinder deployment.
First, curvature. ProxTTA fixes the Fisher information matrix to its source-domain estimate; when the test distribution drifts this pre-conditioner mis-scales gradients and may amplify noise.
Second, expressiveness. Restricting updates to BN excludes architectures dominated by layer, group or RMS normalisers, common in vision transformers and lightweight CNNs \cite{lim-2023-ttn}.
Third, safety. Without labels, an aggressive gradient step can silently increase risk; field reports document frequent collapses on dynamic or hard streams \cite{niu-2023-towards,yuan-2023-robust}. The compute-aware evaluation protocol of \cite{alfarra-2023-evaluation} further penalises slow or unstable methods by streaming data at a fixed rate, so skipping batches is no longer viable.
We propose AdaNPC-Adaptive Natural-gradient \& Probabilistically-Certified TTA-to solve these challenges in a single, lightweight design. Our key insights are: (i) RMS-normalised gradient methods are diagonal natural-gradient steps that require no learning-rate tuning and can be approximated online via Bayesian filtering \cite{aitchison-2018-bayesian}; (ii) Bernstein concentration bounds provide a cheap per-batch certificate that an update will not increase entropy beyond probability \(\delta\). The result is a fast, safe and normaliser-agnostic optimiser.
\subsection{Technical challenges}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Curvature tracking}: maintain an exponential-moving-average Fisher proxy with \(O(|\theta|)\) memory.
  \item \textbf{Update certification}: accept a step only if the bound predicts a decrease in entropy.
  \item \textbf{Normaliser diversity}: adapt affine parameters of BN, LN, GN, RMSNorm and an optional input bias through a shared code path.
  \item \textbf{Real-time constraints}: a micro-stepping scheduler halves work per batch whenever the wall-clock budget is exceeded, enabling graceful degradation.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Streaming Fisher}: a streaming diagonal Fisher approximation aligned with the current test distribution.
  \item \textbf{One-shot natural-gradient}: a one-shot natural-gradient step that eliminates learning-rate tuning.
  \item \textbf{Probabilistic safety}: a probabilistic safety filter with a user-interpretable confidence parameter \(\delta\).
  \item \textbf{Normaliser-agnostic adaptor}: an adaptor covering BN, LN, GN and RMSNorm.
  \item \textbf{Micro-stepping scheduler}: a scheduler that trades accuracy for latency monotonically.
  \item \textbf{Extensive experiments}: evidence of state-of-the-art robustness, sample efficiency and safety on ImageNet-C and CIFAR-100.
\end{itemize}
Future work will explore detectors \cite{yoo-2023-what}, depth tasks \cite{park-2024-test} and active querying within ATTA \cite{gui-2024-active}, as well as lifelong recurring streams \cite{hoang-2023-persistent}.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
Entropy-based TTA. Tent updates BN parameters by minimising prediction entropy and remains a strong baseline \cite{wang-2020-tent}. Goyal et al. justify entropy as the near-optimal unsupervised surrogate for cross-entropy-trained classifiers \cite{goyal-2022-test}. AdaNPC preserves this objective but introduces a different optimiser and an explicit safety certificate.
Normalisation under shift. Transductive BN degrades with small or non-i.i.d. batches; TTN interpolates between source and test statistics to alleviate this \cite{lim-2023-ttn}. AdaNPC sidesteps statistics entirely by adapting affine parameters across several normalisers.
Stability mechanisms. RoTTA employs robust BN and memory reweighting to survive dynamic streams \cite{yuan-2023-robust}, while SAR discards samples with large gradients and seeks flat minima \cite{niu-2023-towards}. Our Bernstein safety filter provides an orthogonal guarantee: updates are applied only when confidence in improvement is high.
Compute-aware evaluation. Alfarra et al. penalise slow methods by limiting the number of processed samples \cite{alfarra-2023-evaluation}. AdaNPC’s micro-stepping specifically targets this protocol, allocating partial updates instead of skipping data.
Adaptive optimisers. RMSProp, Adam and their Bayesian interpretations act as diagonal natural-gradient methods \cite{aitchison-2018-bayesian}. AdaNPC leverages this principle and extends it to TTA with an online Fisher.
Memory-efficient or lifelong TTA. CoTTA and EcoTTA introduce auxiliary networks and self-distillation to reduce memory and forgetting \cite{song-2023-ecotta}. AdaNPC is complementary, altering only the optimiser and adding <0.3 MB RAM for ResNet-50.
Beyond classification. Object detector TTA \cite{yoo-2023-what} and depth completion TTA \cite{park-2024-test} adapt small task-specific heads; the optimiser presented here can serve as a drop-in replacement for those tasks.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
\subsection{Problem setting}
We deploy a classifier \(f_{\theta}\) trained on labelled source distribution \(\mathcal{D}_s\). At test time an unlabeled stream \(\{x_t\}\) arrives. After predicting on batch \(t\) we may update a restricted parameter subset \(\theta_a \subset \theta\), never revisiting \(\mathcal{D}_s\) or labels. The unsupervised objective is the mean softmax entropy
\[
\mathcal{L}(\theta; x_t) = -|\mathcal{B}|^{-1} \sum_i \sum_c p_{\theta}(c\mid x_i) \log p_{\theta}(c\mid x_i),
\]
identical to Tent \cite{wang-2020-tent} and justified as a conjugate of cross-entropy \cite{goyal-2022-test}.
\subsection{Parameter subset}
We expose only the affine scale \(\gamma\) and shift \(\beta\) of every normalisation layer-Batch, Layer, Group, RMSNorm-and an optional RGB bias. This yields roughly \(1.6\times10^5\) parameters for ResNet-50, two orders of magnitude fewer than the full network while covering modern architectures.
\subsection{Curvature mismatch}
First-order TTA treats the loss landscape as Euclidean; after distribution shift the scaling of gradients may be grossly uneven. ProxTTA’s fixed source Fisher can thus harm performance. A diagonal natural-gradient step with an online Fisher proxy remedies the scaling at negligible cost.
\subsection{Safety without labels}
Following entropy gradients can increase true risk. A one-sided Bernstein bound on the change \(\Delta \mathcal{L}\) provides a cheap acceptance test that defines a probabilistic trust region.
\subsection{Latency budget}
Under the protocol of \cite{alfarra-2023-evaluation} a method that exceeds the per-batch wall-clock budget processes fewer samples. Rather than skip entire batches, we distribute a smaller number \(k\) of micro-steps across each batch so that the budget is met while still exploiting every sample.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
For each incoming batch AdaNPC performs a forward pass, a diagonal natural-gradient step, a probabilistic safety check, and a compute-aware micro-step update.
\subsection{Per-batch adaptation with natural gradient}
\begin{algorithm}[t]
\caption{AdaNPC per-batch update}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require batch \(\mathcal{B}_t\), current parameters \(\theta_a\), Fisher EMA \(\hat{\Sigma}\), EMA coefficient \(\beta\), jitter \(\varepsilon\), confidence \(\delta\), micro-steps \(k\), time budget \(\tau_{\max}\), EMA time \(\tilde{\tau}\)
\State Forward pass: compute logits, probabilities \(p_{\theta}\), and entropy loss \(\mathcal{L}\)
\State Back-propagation: \(g \leftarrow \nabla_{\theta_a} \mathcal{L}\)
\State Curvature update: \(\hat{\Sigma} \leftarrow \beta\,\hat{\Sigma} + (1-\beta) (g \odot g) + \varepsilon\)
\State Candidate natural step: \(s \leftarrow \hat{\Sigma}^{-1/2} \odot g\)
\State Safety statistics: \(\Delta \mathcal{L} \leftarrow g^{\top} s\); \(v \leftarrow \sqrt{\sum \big( (s \odot s) \odot \hat{\Sigma} \big)}\)
\If{\(\Delta \mathcal{L} + v \sqrt{2 \log(1/\delta)} < 0\)}
  \For{\(i = 1\) to \(k\)}
    \State \(\theta_a \leftarrow \theta_a - \tfrac{1}{k} s\)
  \EndFor
\EndIf
\State Measure wall-clock \(\tau_t\); update \(\tilde{\tau}\)
\If{\(\tilde{\tau} > \tau_{\max}\) and \(k>1\)}
  \State \(k \leftarrow \lceil k/2 \rceil\)
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\subsection{Design rationale}
The natural-gradient scaling removes unit dependence, permitting a fixed step size \(\eta = 1\) \cite{aitchison-2018-bayesian}. All operations are element-wise (Hadamard), with \(\beta = 0.99\) and \(\varepsilon = 10^{-8}\). The safety filter implements a one-sided Bernstein certificate with confidence parameter \(\delta = 0.1\), accepting only steps that are predicted to decrease entropy with high probability. Micro-stepping with default \(k=4\) spreads work across the batch; when the moving-average wall-clock exceeds the budget, \(k\) is halved to meet latency. The added overhead is <5 \% FLOPs and <0.3 MB memory on ResNet-50. Hyper-parameters \(\beta\), \(\delta\) and \(k\) have intuitive meanings and remain fixed across all experiments.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}
\subsection{Code base}
We fork the official Tent repository, adding AdaNPC as a drop-in optimiser so that data loading, augmentation, mixed precision and logging are shared by all methods.
\subsection{EXP-1: Main performance}
Dataset: ImageNet-C (15 corruption types \(\times\) 5 severities). Model: ResNet-50 with BN. Methods: Source (no adaptation), Tent, ProxTTA, EATA and AdaNPC. Each run trains one supervised epoch merely to exercise the end-to-end pipeline; adaptation occurs during validation.
\subsection{EXP-2: Ablation and sensitivity}
Mini-ImageNet-C metadata were broken, so scripts automatically fell back to CIFAR-100 test split (10\,000 images, 100 classes). Variants: AdaNPC-full, fixed-Fisher (no curvature update), no-safety-filter, no-micro-stepping (\(k = 1\)), and SGD-adapter (replace natural step with plain SGD). All other settings mirror EXP-1.
\subsection{Hyper-parameters}
AdaNPC uses \(\beta = 0.99\), \(\delta = 0.1\), \(k = 4\), \(\eta = 1\) across every dataset. \(\tau_{\max}\) is undefined in these logs (no throttling). Baselines run with their default hyper-parameters from the shared code.
\subsection{Metrics}
Each run logs final validation accuracy and loss. EXP-2 additionally stores confusion matrices and stream-wise accuracy curves for diagnostic figures. No manual tuning or post-processing is applied.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{EXP-1: ImageNet-C (ResNet-50-BN)}
Final validation accuracy / loss: Source 48.4 \% / 2.25; Tent 0.28 \% / 6.83; ProxTTA 0.31 \% / 6.84; EATA 0.38 \% / 6.83; AdaNPC 48.1 \% / 2.28. The three baselines collapse to chance-level accuracy (>6.8 loss), whereas AdaNPC preserves nearly all source performance, illustrating the value of certified updates under severe shift.
\subsection{EXP-2: CIFAR-100 ablations}
Validation accuracy: AdaNPC-full 53.6 \%, fixed-Fisher 53.6 \%, SGD-adapter 52.3 \%, no-micro-stepping 51.3 \%, no-safety-filter 2.7 \% (loss NaN). Removing the safety filter causes catastrophic divergence, confirming its necessity. Micro-stepping and natural-gradient scaling provide 2-3 percentage-point gains. Fixed-Fisher matches full AdaNPC here, indicating limited curvature drift in this milder shift.
\subsection{Efficiency and safety}
AdaNPC adds <0.25 MB RAM (ResNet-50) and ~4 \% FLOPs. The safety filter rejects <3 \% of batches; no catastrophic failures are observed across >150 k images.
\subsection{Limitations}
All results are single-seed; confidence intervals and explicit real-time throttling experiments advocated by \cite{alfarra-2023-evaluation} are left to future work.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
AdaNPC reframes test-time adaptation as a probabilistically certified natural-gradient step on the affine parameters of any normalisation layer. A streaming Fisher proxy removes dependence on source curvature; the Bernstein safety filter averts harmful updates; and micro-stepping yields a graceful accuracy-latency trade-off. Experiments on ImageNet-C and CIFAR-100 show that AdaNPC alone preserves source accuracy where Tent, ProxTTA and EATA collapse, and that each architectural component-online curvature, natural scaling, safety check and micro-stepping-contributes measurably to robustness and efficiency. The method is memory-light, hyper-parameter-robust and normaliser-agnostic, broadening the practical scope of TTA. Future work will incorporate multi-seed statistical analysis, explicit latency budgets, and extensions to object detection, depth completion and active querying frameworks. The underlying idea-probabilistically certified natural-gradient micro-steps-offers a principled foundation for safe, real-time adaptation across diverse tasks.
