Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher. Based on the new research method described in # New Methods, please design an overall experimental strategy that will be applied across all experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

# Instructions
- Define a comprehensive experimental strategy that will guide multiple experiments.
- This strategy should be common to all experiments that will be conducted.
- The strategy should address:
    - What aspects of the proposed method need to be validated (e.g., performance improvement, efficiency, robustness, generalization)
    - What types of comparisons are necessary (e.g., baselines, ablations, state-of-the-art methods)
    - What experimental angles will be used to validate the claims (e.g., quantitative performance, qualitative analysis, computational cost)
    - How to demonstrate the method's effectiveness from multiple perspectives
    - What validation criteria will determine success
- The strategy should be realistic and take into account the experimental environment.
- Focus on the overall approach rather than specific experiment details (which will be defined in subsequent steps).

    "Open Problems": "1. (Scope) Closed–form proximal updates in ProxTTA are limited to frozen Σ taken from the source domain. In practice, the Hessian/Fisher of the test distribution may drift, making the pre-conditioner sub-optimal or even harmful when the shift is large or non-stationary.\n2. (Expressiveness) Restricting adaptation to BN affine parameters fails when the source model uses other normalisers (LN, GN, RMSNorm) or when shifts mainly affect early convolutional filters or input statistics.\n3. (Safety) Even per-parameter trust-region steps can overshoot on extremely hard samples; a cheap on-line certificate of improvement is missing.\n4. (Latency) Skipping whole batches when the time budget is tight wastes potentially useful statistics; we need finer control that degrades gracefully instead of all-or-nothing.",
    "Methods": "We propose AdaNPC – Adaptive Natural-gradient & Probabilistically-Certified Test-time Adaptation.\n\nKey pieces:\nA. Streaming Fisher approximation  Σ̂_t  \na) maintain an exponential moving average of squared gradients g_t ⊙ g_t.  Σ̂_t = β Σ̂_{t-1}+(1-β)(g_t^2+ϵ) (diagonal)  (β=0.99).\nThis tracks curvature of the *current* test stream with O(|θ|) memory and ≤2 Hadamard ops.\n\nB. One-shot natural update  θ_{t+1}=θ_t−η Σ̂_t^{-1/2} g_t  with fixed η=1.  Scaling by Σ̂_t^{-1/2} (RMSprop view) keeps units stable; no learning-rate tuning.\n\nC. Probabilistic safety filter  Using Bernstein’s inequality we bound the change in entropy ΔL. We accept the update only if P(ΔL>0)≤δ (δ=0.1). Cost: one inner-product and pre-computed variance proxy.\n\nD. Normaliser-agnostic adaptors  Collect affine parameters of all normalisation layers (BN, LN, GN, RMSNorm) plus optional input colour-bias vector (3 extra params). Same code path, still O(|θ|).\n\nE. Micro-stepping scheduler  Instead of skipping batches, if wall-clock τ_t>τ_max we halve the micro-step count k (default k=4) so each batch gets a partial update using  θ_{t+1}=θ_t−(η/k) Σ̂_t^{-1/2} g_t repeated k_iter times or until budget met. Guarantees monotone accuracy-vs-time trade-off.\n\nAll hyper-parameters (β, δ, τ_max) have intuitive meanings and are insensitive; none depend on the model or dataset.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Code base: extend official Tent repo.\n\nModels & datasets: • ResNet-50-BN on ImageNet-C. • ViT-B/16-LN on ImageNet-C. • ResNet-18-GN on CIFAR-10-C. Streams: Realistic protocol with η∈{1,1/2,1/4}. Recurring PTTA Dirichlet δ=0.1.\n\nBaselines: Source, Tent, ProxTTA, EATA, RoTTA, CoTTA, Shrink-Tent.\n\nMetrics: 1) Online top-1 error under time penalty. 2) Time-to-90%-of-Tent accuracy. 3) Ratio of safe-filter rejections (<5% desired). 4) Extra memory (should <0.3 MB for R-50).",
    "Experimental Code": "class AdaNPC(Tent):\n    def __init__(self, model, beta=0.99, delta=0.1, tau_max=None):\n        super().__init__(model, torch.optim.SGD([],lr=1))\n        self.var = None            # Σ̂_t diagonal\n        self.beta=beta; self.delta=delta\n        self.tau_max=tau_max; self.k=4  # micro-steps\n        self.timer_ema=None\n    @torch.enable_grad()\n    def forward_and_adapt(self,x,model,opt):\n        t0=time.time()\n        y=model(x); loss=softmax_entropy(y).mean()\n        g=torch.autograd.grad(loss,self.params,create_graph=False)[0]\n        if self.var is None: self.var=g.pow(2)\n        else: self.var=self.beta*self.var+(1-self.beta)*g.pow(2)+1e-8\n        step=(g/self.var.sqrt())            # Σ̂^{-1/2}g\n        # safety: accept only if predicted ΔL negative with high prob\n        deltaL=(step*g).sum()              # first-order change\n        varL=((step.pow(2)*self.var).sum()).sqrt()\n        safe=(deltaL+varL*math.sqrt(2*math.log(1/self.delta)))<0\n        if safe:\n            k=max(1,self.k)\n            eta=1.0/k\n            for _ in range(k):\n                for p,s in zip(self.params,step): p-=eta*s\n        self.timer_ema=0.8*(self.timer_ema or 0)+0.2*(time.time()-t0)\n        if self.tau_max and self.timer_ema>self.tau_max and self.k>1:\n            self.k//=2     # micro-step back-off\n        model.zero_grad(); return model(x)",
    "Expected Result": "• AdaNPC matches Tent’s final accuracy after only 0.5 epochs of data (≈30% fewer samples) and beats ProxTTA by 1-2 pp on ImageNet-C.\n• Under η=1/4 it retains 93% of its full-speed accuracy, versus 75% for Tent and 88% for ProxTTA.\n• Safety filter rejects <3% of batches yet prevents all observed divergences on extreme corruptions (snow, impulse_noise).\n• Overhead: +|θ| vector and var buffer (0.25 MB for R-50), <5% extra FLOPs.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "AdaNPC turns TTA into a fast, normaliser-agnostic, and self-certified one-step natural-gradient procedure. By tracking curvature online it eliminates source-bias of fixed Fisher, while the probabilistic filter delivers theoretical safety guarantees. Fine-grained micro-stepping makes adaptation speed smoothly adjustable to real-time constraints. The method thus advances both the practical deployability and the theoretical grounding of rapid test-time adaptation."

    "experiment_strategy": "Overall Goal:\nDemonstrate that AdaNPC delivers (1) higher on-line performance, (2) better computational efficiency, (3) stronger robustness/safety and (4) wider architectural generalization than existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) techniques.\n\n1. Validation Axes\n   a. Performance Improvement – on-line accuracy/error under various distribution shifts.\n   b. Efficiency – wall-clock latency, extra FLOPs, extra memory, and sample-efficiency (# test samples required to reach a target accuracy).\n   c. Robustness & Safety – stability on extreme or non-stationary shifts; frequency of divergence and of safety-filter rejections; guarantee that accuracy never drops below the frozen source model.\n   d. Generalization – effectiveness across architectures (BN, LN, GN, RMSNorm), data domains, and shift types (corruption intensity, temporal drift, sudden swaps).\n   e. Graceful Degradation – accuracy–vs–time trade-off controlled by micro-stepping.\n\n2. Required Comparisons\n   • Strong baselines: Source (no TTA), Tent, ProxTTA, EATA, CoTTA, RoTTA, Shrink-Tent, and any contemporaneous state-of-the-art published before the submission deadline.\n   • Internal ablations: (i) remove streaming Fisher (fall back to fixed Σ), (ii) remove probabilistic safety filter, (iii) remove micro-stepping, (iv) adapt BN only, (v) replace natural gradient with SGD; (vi) combine two removals to test interaction effects.\n   • Sensitivity studies: vary β, δ, micro-step budget, and η to show hyper-parameter robustness.\n\n3. Experimental Angles / Evidence Modalities\n   A. Quantitative\n      • Main metric: on-line top-1 error averaged over the whole stream.\n      • Secondary: (i) area under the adaptation curve (AUC), (ii) time-to-X%-of-Tent accuracy, (iii) catastrophic failure rate (runs where error > source), (iv) % batches rejected by safety filter, (v) compute & memory overhead, (vi) energy proxy via NVIDIA-SMI.\n      • Statistical treatment: 3 independent runs × 3 random seeds; report mean ± 95% CI; paired t-tests against best baseline.\n   B. Qualitative / Diagnostic\n      • Fisher drift plots (cosine similarity between Σ̂_t and source Σ_0).\n      • Histograms of predicted ΔL vs empirical ΔL, highlighting safety bound tightness.\n      • Accuracy–vs–latency curves when throttling τ_max.\n      • Heat-map of component ablations across corruption severity.\n\n4. Multi-Perspective Demonstration Plan\n   • Orthogonal matrix: {Architectures} × {Datasets} × {Shift protocols}. Each cell runs the full comparison suite to show broad applicability.\n   • Stress tests: (i) worst-case corruptions, (ii) synthetic non-stationary drift generated on-the-fly, (iii) adversarially sorted hard batches.\n   • Real-time constraint scenario: enforce τ_max values (full, ½, ¼ of GPU budget) to showcase graceful degradation.\n   • Safety spotlight: run 10×-long streams; count divergences; compare cumulative worst-case error to baselines.\n\n5. Success Criteria (must hold on ≥80% of cells)\n   • Accuracy: AdaNPC improves mean AUC by ≥2 pp over the best competing method with p<0.05.\n   • Efficiency: <5% extra FLOPs, <0.5% extra VRAM, and reaches Tent’s final accuracy using ≥25% fewer test samples.\n   • Robustness: zero catastrophic failures; safety filter rejection rate ≤5%.\n   • Generalization: retains ≥90% of its ImageNet-C gain when ported to each other architecture/dataset without tuning.\n   • Graceful degradation: under the strictest τ_max, retains ≥90% of its own full-speed accuracy while Tent drops below 80%.\n\n6. Practical Considerations\n   • All experiments run on one NVIDIA A100 (80 GB) node; resource accounting recorded via NVTX markers and pytorch profiler.\n   • Unified codebase: start from official Tent repo, add modular hooks so baselines and AdaNPC share identical data loading, augmentation, synchronisation and precision settings.\n   • Hyper-parameter policy: AdaNPC fixed defaults; baselines get per-dataset grid search as reported in their papers to avoid under-tuning claims.\n   • Reproducibility: release seeds, config files, and slurm scripts; adherence to ML-Reproducibility Checklist.\n\nThis strategy provides a consistent, multi-faceted evaluation framework that will be reused verbatim in all subsequent experiments, ensuring that every study collectively builds a compelling, well-substantiated case for the effectiveness of AdaNPC."
