# Paper Outline
The paper first introduces the recurring TTA setting, which extends practical TTA by allowing environments to recur over time. It then conducts a theoretical analysis using an e-perturbed binary Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier (e-GMMC) to simulate and understand model collapse, where the pseudo-label predictor is perturbed to maintain a false negative rate. This analysis explains factors contributing to collapse: prior data distribution, intrinsic category differences, update rate, and false negative rate (FNR). PeTTA, the proposed method, equips TTA with a mechanism to sense divergence from the initial model (theta0) by measuring the Mahalanobis distance of feature embedding vectors' first moments (gamma_y_t). It then adaptively adjusts the regularization term coefficient (lambda_t) and the EMA update rate (alpha_t) based on this sensed divergence, prioritizing collapse prevention when deviation is significant. PeTTA integrates these adaptive parameters with a mean teacher update framework, category-balanced memory bank, robust batch normalization, and an anchor loss (LAL) which minimizes KL divergence between current and source model predictions.
