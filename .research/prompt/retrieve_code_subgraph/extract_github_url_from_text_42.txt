Input:
# Task
You carefully read the contents of the “Paper Outline” and select one GitHub link from the “GitHub URLs List” that you think is most relevant to the contents.
# Constraints
- Output the index number corresponding to the selected GitHub URL.
- Be sure to select only one GitHub URL.
- If there is no related GitHub link, output None.
# Paper Outline
EcoTTA consists of two main components. First, a memory-efficient architecture uses frozen original networks to discard intermediate activations, attaching lightweight meta networks (one batch normalization and one convolution block) to K partitioned parts of the original network. These meta networks are warmed up on source data before deployment. Shallow layers of the encoder are partitioned more densely. Second, a self-distilled regularization method is introduced, employing an L1 loss (Rk = ||~xk - xk||1) to prevent the meta network's output (~xk) from significantly deviating from the frozen original network's output (xk). This preserves source knowledge and prevents error accumulation. The overall loss combines entropy minimization (Lent) with this regularization loss (Ltotal = Lent + λ * sum(Rk)).
