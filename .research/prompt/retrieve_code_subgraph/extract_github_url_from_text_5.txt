# Paper Outline
RoTTA consists of three main components: (1) Robust Batch Normalization (RBN) replaces traditional batch statistics with global ones maintained by an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to robustly normalize feature maps, initialized from the pre-trained model's running statistics and updated using buffered samples. (2) Category-Balanced Sampling with Timeliness and Uncertainty (CSTU) manages a memory bank by prioritizing samples that are newer and less uncertain. It uses pseudo-labels for category balancing and assigns a heuristic score based on sample age and prediction entropy to guide replacement. (3) Robust Training with Timeliness utilizes a teacher-student model architecture. The student model's affine parameters in RBN are updated by minimizing a loss function over the memory bank samples, incorporating a timeliness reweighting term (E(Ai)) that reduces the influence of older samples. The teacher model's parameters are updated via EMA of the student's parameters. The training loss is a cross-entropy between the student's prediction on strong-augmented views and the teacher's prediction on weak-augmented views.
