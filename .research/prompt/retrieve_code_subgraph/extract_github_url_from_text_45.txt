# Paper Outline
The paper first establishes a theoretical foundation using an ϵ-perturbed Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier (ϵ-GMMC) to simulate and analyze model collapse, identifying data- and algorithm-dependent factors. Based on these insights, it proposes Persistent TTA (PeTTA). PeTTA employs a divergence sensing mechanism that measures the Mahalanobis distance of feature embedding vectors from the source model's statistics (γy t). This sensed divergence (¯γt) is then used to adaptively adjust the regularization coefficient (λt) and the exponential moving average (EMA) update rate (αt) of the mean-teacher model, balancing adaptation and collapse prevention. It also incorporates an anchor loss (LAL) to minimize KL divergence between the current and source model's output probabilities, along with a category-balanced memory bank and robust batch normalization from prior work.
