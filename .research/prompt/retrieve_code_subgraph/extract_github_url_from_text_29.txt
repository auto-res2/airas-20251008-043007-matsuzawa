# Paper Outline
The ATTA problem is formally defined, aiming to optimize a pre-trained model on streaming test data by actively selecting and labeling informative instances within a budget. The theoretical framework analyzes how ATTA alleviates distribution shifts through active learning and combats catastrophic forgetting (CF) using a selective entropy minimization approach. Specifically, low-entropy samples (well-aligned with the source-pretrained model) are pseudo-labeled to act as 'source-like' data, helping to prevent CF. High-entropy samples are actively selected for annotation. The SimATTA algorithm implements this by partitioning unlabeled test samples into high and low entropy sets. High-entropy samples are selected using an incremental clustering technique (based on weighted K-means) to obtain diverse and representative 'anchors' for oracle labeling. The model is then fine-tuned using these labeled anchors and the pseudo-labeled low-entropy samples, with balanced weighting to optimize for both target domain performance and CF avoidance.
