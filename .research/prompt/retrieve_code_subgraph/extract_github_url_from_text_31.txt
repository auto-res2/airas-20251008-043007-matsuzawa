# Paper Outline
RoTTA addresses PTTA challenges with three main components. First, Robust Batch Normalization (RBN) is introduced to stably estimate normalization statistics, replacing current batch statistics with global ones maintained by exponential moving average from buffered samples. Second, a Category-Balanced Sampling with Timeliness and Uncertainty (CSTU) memory bank is utilized. This memory bank samples data to maintain category balance while prioritizing newer and less uncertain samples based on a heuristic score. Third, robust training with timeliness is implemented using a teacher-student model. The student model is updated by minimizing a loss on the memory bank, and the teacher model is updated via an exponential moving average of the student's parameters. A time-aware reweighting strategy assigns lower weights to older samples in the loss calculation to stabilize adaptation, and only affine parameters in RBN are trained.
